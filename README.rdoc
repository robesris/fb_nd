== About

fb_nd is the first playable implementation of a little-known and out of print board game.
Up until now, the only way to play online has been through the program Vassal, which
provides a virtual set, but does not enforce any rules.

== Installation

rvm use ruby-1.9.2-p180
bundle install --path=vendor
rake db:migrate
rails s

== Testing

RAILS_ENV=test rake db:migrate
bundle exec cucumber features
